# binance_ohlcv_download_tool
Tool to download Binance OHLCV data.

A small mish mash of code that I hacked together to create a tool that downloads OHLCV data from binance.
Currently, it's invoked through the function, but eventually will make this in a command line interface, and
later, operable through a GUI to make it more user friendly.

It's one of my first projects, so the code is probably really inefficient, and am happy to take feedback.
